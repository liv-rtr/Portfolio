# Cleaned Data
In this folder you will find 5 .csv files: 'region_raw', 'division_raw', 'state_raw', 'county_raw', and 'place_raw' containing cleaned versions of the data at each geography level.

Notable changes to the data include renaming the columns, removing the brackets and quotation marks from the text columns, and changing the data types of the 'Estimate' and 'Percent' variables.
These changes were made in Excel Power Query which can be viewed in the 'clean_data_queries.xls' file found in the main 'Data Cleaning' folder.
