# Raw Data
In this folder you will find 5 .txt files containg the raw data from the API calls. These are exact copies of the outputs from each API call using the acs5 variables and were saved as .txt files so they could be loaded into Excel Power Query for cleaning purposes.

If running the 'clean_data_queries.xls' file, these .txt. files will need to be downloaded and the location of said downloads will need to be set as the data source for its respective query in Excel.
