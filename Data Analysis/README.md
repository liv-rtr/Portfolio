# Data Analysis

In this folder you will find the following items:

1. DataAnalysis_Coasters.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook
2. coasters.csv - Dataset

These two items are a part of a personal project modeled around other academic assignments and were used to practice data analysis. The Jupyter Notebook was written in a question and answer format, similar to what would have been assigned to me during my undergraduate education. I chose this format to practice finding insights that may be useful for a business using questions that they might ask, aswell as some more technical questions for something that a supervisor may inquire about. 

Note: I no longer have access to the original source of this data as it was provided within an academic assignment.
