# Data Visualization

In this folder you will find the following items:
1. RUCC_2023.csv - Data Source
2. RUCC_Visualization.twb - Tableau Workbook

These are apart of an academic project that was modified at a later date. This project explores the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes for U.S. States and Territories. It encapsulates multiple data visualization techniques including but not limited to maps, bar charts, tableau stories, and interactive paramaters. The raw data can be found here: [https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes/). This data was then loaded into Excel Power Query and merged with [this](https://github.com/jasonong/List-of-US-States/blob/master/states.csv) dataset to add full state names to the provided state abbreviations. The final, cleaned dataset is what is included in this folder.
